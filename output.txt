According to  , the Johannesburg–  urban area (combined because of strong transport links that make commuting feasible) is the 26th-largest in the world in terms of population, with 14,167,000 inhabitants.  It is the   capital and largest city of  , which is the wealthiest province in South Africa.  Johannesburg is the seat of the  , the highest court in South Africa.  Most of the major South African companies and banks have their head offices in Johannesburg. The city is located within the mineral-rich   hills, the epicentre of the international-scale mineral, gold and (specifically) diamond trade.
 The city was established in 1886, following the discovery of gold, on what had been a farm. Due to the extremely large gold deposits found along the  ,  within ten years, the population had grown to over 100,000 inhabitants. A separate city from the late 1970s until 1994,   is now part of the Greater Johannesburg metropolitan area. An acronym for "South-Western Townships", Soweto was organised initially as a collection of nondescript settlements on the outskirts of the city, populated mostly by African labourers working in the gold mining industry. Soweto, although eventually incorporated into Johannesburg, had been explicitly separated as a residential area for blacks only—no whites allowed—who were not permitted to live in other "white-designated" areas of Johannesburg. Another region,  , is predominantly populated by English-speaking Indo-South Africans (people of   and   descent). These areas were, in previous decades, designated as non-white areas, in accordance with the segregationist policies of the time—known as  . It would go on to be one of the host cities of the official tournament of the  —and it hosted the  .
 The   is an  , as listed by the  . In 2019, the population of the city of Johannesburg was 5 635 127, making it the   in South Africa.  In the same year, the population of metro Johannesburg's   was put at 8 000 000.  Land area of the municipal city (1,645 km  or 635 sq mi) is large in comparison with those of other major cities, resulting in a moderate population density of 2,364 per square kilometre (6,120/sq mi).
 Controversy surrounds the origin of the name. There were quite a number of people with the name "Johannes" who were involved in the early history of the city. Among them is the principal clerk attached to the office of the surveyor-general Hendrik Dercksen,  , who was a member of the   and was the Republic's chief of mining. Another was Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger (better known as  ), president of the South African Republic (ZAR) from 1883 to 1900. Johannes Meyer, the first government official in the area is another possibility. 
 Precise records for the choice of name were lost. Johannes Rissik and Johannes Joubert were members of a delegation sent to   to obtain mining rights for the area. Joubert had a park in the city named after him, and Rissik has his name for one of the main streets in the city where the historically important albeit dilapidated   is located.  The   is also located on Rissik Street.
 The region surrounding Johannesburg was originally inhabited by   hunter-gatherers who used stone tools. There is evidence that they lived there up to ten centuries ago.  Stone-walled ruins of Sotho–Tswana towns and villages are scattered around the parts of the former   in which Johannesburg is situated. 
 By the mid-18th century, the broader region was largely settled by various   communities (one linguistic branch of Bantu-speakers), whose villages, towns, chiefdoms and kingdoms stretched from the   (what is now  ) in the west,  to present day   in the south,  to the present day   areas of the  . More specifically, the stone-walled ruins of   towns and villages are scattered around the parts of the former Transvaal province in which Johannesburg is situated.
 Many Sotho–Tswana towns and villages in the areas around Johannesburg were destroyed and their people driven away during the wars emanating from   during the late 18th and early 19th centuries (the   or difaqane wars),  and as a result, an offshoot of the Zulu kingdom, the   (often referred to as the Matabele, the name given them by the local Sotho–Tswana), set up a kingdom to the northwest of Johannesburg around modern-day Rustenburg.
 The main Witwatersrand gold reef was discovered in June 1884 on the farm Vogelstruisfontein by  , son of  , this triggered the   and the founding of Johannesburg in 1886. The discovery of gold rapidly attracted people to the area, making necessary a name and governmental organisation for the area. Jan, Johan and Johannes were common male names among the Dutch of that time; two men involved in surveying the area for the best location of the city, Christian Johannes Joubert and Johann Rissik, are considered the source of the name by some. Johannes Meyer, the first government official in the area is another possibility. Precise records for the choice of name were lost.  Within ten years, the city of Johannesburg included 100,000 people. 
 In September 1884, the Struben brothers discovered the Confidence Reef on the farm Wilgespruit near present-day Roodepoort, which further boosted excitement over gold prospects.  The first gold to be crushed on the Witwatersrand was the gold-bearing rock from the Bantjes mine crushed using the Struben brothers stamp machine. News of the discovery soon reached Kimberley and directors Cecil Rhodes and Sir Joseph Robinson rode up to investigate the rumours for themselves. They were guided to the Bantjes camp with its tents strung out over several kilometres and stayed with Bantjes for two nights. 
 In 1884, they purchased the first pure refined gold from Bantjes for £3,000. Incidentally, Bantjes had from 1881 been operating the Kromdraai Gold Mine in the Cradle of Humankind together with his partner Johannes Stephanus Minnaar where they first discovered gold in 1881, and which also offered another kind of discovery—the early ancestors of all mankind.  Some report Australian George Harrison as the first to make a claim for gold in the area that became Johannesburg, as he found gold on a farm in July 1886. He did not remain in the area. 
 Gold was earlier discovered some 400 kilometres (249 miles) to the east of present-day Johannesburg in  .   soon discovered the richer gold reefs of the   offered by Bantjes. The original miners' camp, under the informal leadership of Col  , was located in the Fordsburg dip, possibly because water was available there, and because of the site's proximity to the diggings. Following the establishment of Johannesburg, the area was taken over by the Transvaal government who had it surveyed and named it Ferreira's Township, today the suburb of  . The first settlement at Ferreira's Camp was established as a tented camp and which soon reached a population of 3,000 by 1887.  The government took over the camp, surveyed it and named it Ferreira's Township.  By 1896, Johannesburg was established as a city of over 100,000 inhabitants, one of the fastest growth cities ever. 
 Mines near Johannesburg are among the deepest in the world, with some as deep as 4,000 metres (13,000 ft). 
 Like many late 19th-century mining towns, Johannesburg was a rough and disorganised place, populated by white miners from all continents, African tribesmen were recruited to perform unskilled mine work, African women beer brewers cooked for and sold beer to the black migrant workers, a very large number of European prostitutes, gangsters, impoverished Afrikaners, tradesmen, and the " ", Zulu men who surprisingly dominated laundry work.  As the value of control of the land increased, tensions developed between the  –dominated Transvaal government in Pretoria and the British, culminating in the   that ended in fiasco at   in January 1896. The   (1899–1902) saw British forces under Field Marshal Frederick Sleigh Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts, occupy the city on 30 May 1900 after a series of battles to the south-west of its then-limits, near present-day Krugersdorp. 
 Fighting took place at the Gatsrand Pass (near Zakariyya Park) on 27 May, north of Vanwyksrust—today's Nancefield,   and Naturena—the next day, culminating in a mass infantry attack on what is now the waterworks ridge in Chiawelo and Senaoane on 29 May. 
 During the Boer war, many African mineworkers left Johannesburg creating a labour shortage, which the mines ameliorated by bringing in labourers from China, especially southern China. After the war, they were replaced by black workers, but many Chinese stayed on, creating Johannesburg's Chinese community, which during the apartheid era, was not legally classified as "Asian", but as "Coloured". The population in 1904 was 155,642, of whom 83,363 were  . 
 In 1917, Johannesburg became the headquarters of the   founded by   which ultimately became one of the world's largest corporations, dominating both gold-mining and diamond-mining in South Africa. Major building developments took place in the 1930s, after South Africa went off the gold standard.  In the late 1940s and early 1950s,   went high-rise. In the 1950s and early 1960s, the apartheid government constructed the massive agglomeration of townships that became known as  . New freeways encouraged massive sub  to the north of the city.  In the late 1960s and early 1970s, tower blocks (including the   and the  ) filled the skyline of the central business district.
 Under the system of   (Afrikaans for "apartness", or "separate development" although the system was founded by the British), a comprehensive system of racial separation was imposed upon South Africa starting in 1948. For its growth, the economy of Johannesburg depended upon hundreds of thousands of skilled white workers imported from Europe and semi- and un-skilled black workers imported from other parts of Southern Africa. Though they worked together they were forced by the government to live separately. Work was considered to be an exception to   in order to keep Johannesburg functioning as South Africa's economic capital. 
 In the 1950s, the government began a policy of building townships for black families (prior to this unskilled workers were asked to work on "single status" in male-only hostels at the mines and had to commute to see their families in whatever province they originated) outside of Johannesburg to provide workers for Johannesburg.   , a township founded for black workers coming to work in the gold mines of Johannesburg, was intended to house 50,000 people, but soon was the home of ten times that number as thousands of unemployed rural blacks came to Johannesburg for employment and an income to send back to their villages.  It was estimated that in 1989, the population of Soweto was equal to that of Johannesburg, if not greater. 
 In March 1960, Johannesburg witnessed widespread demonstrations against   in response to the  .  On 11 July 1963, the   raided a house in the Johannesburg suburb of   where nine members of the banned   (ANC) were arrested on charges of planning sabotage. Their arrest led to the famous  .  The nine arrested included one Indo-South African, one coloured, two whites and five blacks, one of whom was the future president  .  At their trial, the accused freely admitted that they were guilty of what they were charged with, namely of planning to blow up the hydro-electric system of Johannesburg to shut down the gold mines, but Mandela argued to the court that the ANC had tried non-violent resistance to   and failed, leaving him with no other choice.  The trial made Mandela into a national figure and a symbol of resistance to  . 
 On 16 June 1976, demonstrations broke out in Soweto over a government decree that black school-children be educated in Afrikaans instead of English, and after the police fired on the demonstrations, rioting against   began in Soweto and spread into the greater Johannesburg area.  About 575 people, the majority of whom were black, were killed in the   of 1976.  Between 1984 and 1986, South Africa was in turmoil as a series of nationwide protests, strikes and riots took place against  , and the black townships around Johannesburg were scenes of some of the fiercest struggles between the police and anti-  demonstrators. 
 The central area of the city underwent something of a decline in the 1980s and 1990s, due to the high crime rate and when property speculators directed large amounts of capital into suburban shopping malls, decentralised office parks, and entertainment centres.   was opened in 1973, followed by Rosebank Mall in 1976, and   in 1979. 
 During the 1990s, the city faced rapid growth of crime throughout large parts of the city. Some areas of skyscrapers were abandoned, many residents left their homes, and businesses moved out. Some historical buildings in central areas were destroyed by fires that spread relentlessly. 
 Like many cities around the world, there is an increasing focus on the rejuvenation of the inner city of Johannesburg. One of these initiatives is the Maboneng District located on the south-eastern side of the  . Originally a hub for art, it has expanded to include restaurants, entertainment venues and retail stores as well as accommodation and hotels. Maboneng calls itself "a place of inspiration—a creative hub, a place to do business, a destination for visitors and a safe, integrated community for residents. A beacon of strength in Africa's most economically prosperous city". 
 After being destroyed in 2008 to make way for a motor showroom by Imperial Holdings, the iconic Rand Steam Laundries are now being redeveloped as an exact replica, by the order of the Johannesburg Heritage Council. Apart from one filtration shed, there is nothing left on the site after being destroyed. The site will consist of a 5,000 m  (54,000 sq ft) precinct. 
 On 12 May 2008, a series of riots started in the township of  , in the north-eastern part of Johannesburg, when locals attacked migrants from  , Malawi and  , killing two people and injuring 40 others. These riots sparked the   attacks of 2008.  The   were similar in nature and origin to the  .

 Johannesburg is located in the eastern plateau area of South Africa known as the  , at an elevation of 1,753 metres (5,751 ft). The former   is located on the southern side of the prominent ridge called the   (English: White Water's Ridge) and the terrain falls to the north and south. By and large the Witwatersrand marks the watershed between the   and   rivers as the northern part of the city is drained by the   while the southern part of the city, including most of the Central Business District, is drained by the  . The north and west of the city has undulating hills while the eastern parts are flatter.
 Johannesburg may not be built on a river or harbour, but its streams contribute to two of southern Africa's mightiest rivers, the   and the  . Most of the springs from which many of these streams emanate are now covered in concrete and canalised, accounting for the fact that the names of early farms in the area often end with "fontein", meaning "spring" in Afrikaans. Braamfontein, Rietfontein, Zevenfontein, Doornfontein, Zandfontein and Randjesfontein are some examples. When the first white settlers reached the area that is now Johannesburg, they noticed the glistening rocks on the ridges, running with trickles of water, fed by the streams—giving the area its name, the Witwatersrand, "the ridge of white waters". Another explanation is that the whiteness comes from the quartzite rock, which has a particular sheen to it after rain. 
 The site was not chosen for its streams, however. The main reasons the city was founded where it stands today was because of the gold. Indeed, the city once sat near massive amounts of gold, given that at one point the Witwatersrand gold industry produced forty per cent of the planet's gold. 
 Parks and gardens in Johannesburg are maintained by  .  City Parks is also responsible for planting the city's many green trees, making Johannesburg one of the 'greenest' cities in the world. It has been estimated that there are six million trees in the city with the number growing every year—1.2 million on pavements and sidewalks, and a further 4.8 million in private gardens.  City Parks continues to invest in planting trees, particularly those previously disadvantaged areas of Johannesburg which were not positive beneficiaries of apartheid Johannesburg's urban planning.  , located in the suburb of  , is a popular recreational park.
 Johannesburg and environs also offer various options to visitors wishing to view  , in addition to the  , one of the largest in South Africa. The   nature reserve, next to Lesedi Cultural Village, is home to over 80 lions and various other game, while the  , a 1500    , is a forty-minute drive from the city centre. The De Wildt Cheetah Centre  in the   runs a successful breeding program for  ,   and other  . The Rhino & Lion Nature Reserve,  situated in the "Cradle of Humankind" on 1200 ha of "the typical   of Gauteng" also runs a breeding programme for endangered species including Bengal tigers, Siberian tigers and the extremely rare  .  To the south, 11 kilometres (6.8 miles) from the city centre, is the   home to large mammals and hiking trails.
 Johannesburg is situated on the highveld plateau, and has a   (   ). The city enjoys a sunny climate, with the summer months (October to April) characterised by hot days followed by afternoon thundershowers and cool evenings, and the winter months (May to September) by dry, sunny days followed by cold nights.  Temperatures in Johannesburg are usually fairly mild due to the city's high elevation, with an average maximum daytime temperature in January of 25.6 °C (78.1 °F), dropping to an average maximum of around 16 °C (61 °F) in June. The   for Johannesburg in summers is extreme, often reaching 14–16 due to the high elevation and its location in the subtropics. 
 Winter is the sunniest time of the year, with mild days and cool nights, dropping to 4.1 °C (39.4 °F) in June and July. The temperature occasionally drops to below freezing at night, causing  . Snow is a rare occurrence, with snowfall having been experienced in the twentieth century during May 1956, August 1962, June 1964 and September 1981. In the 21st century, there was light sleet in 2006, as well as snow proper on 27 June 2007 (accumulating up to 10 centimetres or 4 inches in the southern suburbs),  7 August 2012,  and 10 July 2023. 
 Regular cold fronts pass over in winter bringing very cold southerly winds but usually clear skies. The annual average rainfall is 713 millimetres (28.1 in), which is mostly concentrated in the summer months. Infrequent showers occur through the course of the winter months. The lowest nighttime minimum temperature ever recorded in Johannesburg is −8.2 °C (17.2 °F), on 13 June 1979. The lowest daytime maximum temperature recorded is 1.5 °C (34.7 °F), on 19 June 1964. 
 According to the 2011  , the population of Johannesburg is 4,434,827 people,  making it the most populous city in South Africa (it has been the most populous city in South Africa since at least the 1950s).  From the 2001 census, the people live in 1,006,930 formal households, of which 86% have a flush or  , and 91% have   removed by the municipality at least once a week. 81% of households have access to running water, and 80% use electricity as the main source of energy. 29% of Johannesburg residents stay in informal dwellings.  66% of households are headed by one person.
 Johannesburg's   spreads well beyond the administrative boundary of the  . The population of the whole area has been estimated to be variously at 7,860,781 in 2011 by "citypopulation.de",  or 9,115,000 in 2018 by   (for "Johannesburg-East Rand", 41st highest in the world).  The area of this urban agglomeration was put by Demographia to be 2,590 km , 31st largest in the world.    are the product of   and are regionalised into north, south, east and west, and they generally have different personalities.  Greater Johannesburg consists of more than five hundred suburbs in an area covering more than two hundred square miles (520 square kilometres).  Although black Africans can be found throughout Johannesburg and its surrounding area, greater Johannesburg remains highly racially segregated. 
 Within the Metropolitan Municipality, the old centre, established in 1886 and given city status in 1928, has been listed in recent censuses as a "main place". As of 2011 , this main place had a population of 957,441 and an area of 334.81 km .  Some authors consider the metropolitan area to include most of Gauteng province.  The  's Population Division in 2016 estimated the metropolitan area population to be 9,616,000. 
 Blacks account for 73% of the population, followed by   at 18%,   at 6% and   at 4%. 42% of the population is under the age of 24, while 6% of the population is over 60 years of age. 37% of city residents are unemployed. 91% of the unemployed are Black African. Women comprise 43% of the working population. 19% of economically active adults work in wholesale and retail sectors, 18% in financial, real estate and business services, 17% in the community, social and personal services and 12% are in manufacturing.

 The   is one of the leading universities in Africa,  and is famous as a centre of resistance to  . It is attached to the world's third largest hospital, the  , located in  .
 The  's business school the   is located in Illovo, Johannesburg.
 Many private colleges are also situated in Johannesburg, such as  ,   ,    and the   of   (six of the other campuses are in Australia, while the eighth is in  ), as well as the   which is located in  .
 Johannesburg also has one of several   in the country, one of which has won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Student Film in 2006.  The South African School of Motion Picture and Live Performance, or   for short, is situated in Auckland Park.
 Johannesburg also has three teacher-training colleges and a technical college. There are numerous kindergartens, primary schools and high schools in the region.
 Johannesburg is the economic and financial hub of South Africa, producing 16% of South Africa's gross domestic product, and accounts for 40% of Gauteng's economic activity.  In a 2008 survey conducted by  , Johannesburg ranked 47 out of 50 top cities in the world as a worldwide centre of commerce (the only city in Africa). 
 Mining was the foundation of the  's economy, but its importance is gradually declining due to dwindling reserves and service and manufacturing industries have become more significant to the city's economy. While gold mining no longer takes place within the  , most mining companies still have their headquarters in Johannesburg. The city's manufacturing industries extend across a range of areas and there is still a reliance on heavy industries including steel and cement plants. The service and other industries include banking, IT, real estate, transport, broadcast and print media, private health care, transport and a vibrant leisure and consumer retail market.  Johannesburg has Africa's largest stock exchange, the   although it has moved out of the central business district. Due to its commercial role, the city is the seat of the provincial government and the site of a number of government branch offices, as well as consular offices and other institutions.
 The Witwatersrand urban complex is a major consumer of water in a dry region. Its continued economic and population growth has depended on schemes to divert water from other regions of South Africa and from the highlands of  , the biggest of which is the  , but additional sources will be needed early in the 21st century.
 The container terminal at   is known to be the largest " " in the world,  with some 50% of cargo that arrives through the ports of   and   arriving in Johannesburg. The City Deep area has been declared an IDZ (industrial development zone) by the Gauteng government. 
 Johannesburg's largest shopping centres, measured by gross leasable area (GLA, the uniform measure of centre size as determined by the International Council of Shopping Centers) are Sandton City, Eastgate, Mall of Africa, Westgate and Cresta.   is one of its most prestigious.  Other centres include  ,  ,  , The Glen Shopping Centre, Johannesburg South, and Clearwater Mall. There were also plans to build a large shopping centre, known as the Zonk'Izizwe Shopping Resort, in  , but these have been indefinitely delayed due to the opening of  . "Zonk'Izizwe" means "All Nations" in  , indicating that the centre will cater to the city's diverse mix of peoples and races. Also a complex named Greenstone in Modderfontein has been opened.  Cradlestone Mall is a new mall named for its location which is close to the  , a World Heritage Site.
 Upon the creation of the Metropolitan Municipality in 2000 the city was subdivided into eleven regions, simply named Region 1 to Region 11. These were reorganized in 2006 into the current seven regions named alphabetically Region A to Region G, as shown on the nearby map. 
 As of 2006  the seven regions are:
 In the 2016 municipal elections, the ruling party, the ANC, lost their majority in Johannesburg for the first time since taking power in 1994, claiming only 44.12% of the vote. The Economic Freedom Fighters and Democratic Alliance both agreed to vote for the DA mayoral candidate,  , who was sworn into power as the first Democratic Alliance mayor of Johannesburg on 22 August 2016.  The ANC returned to the city's executive on 4 December 2019 following the election of its regional chair,  , to the mayoralty.  Makhubo died on 9 July 2021 and   was appointed acting mayor.  A new mayor, Jolidee Matongo, was elected unopposed on 10 August 2021.  Matongo died in a car accident in September 2021 and   was elected to succeed him. 
 After the   was scrapped in 1991, Johannesburg was affected by  . Thousands of poor black people, who had been forbidden to live in the city proper, moved into the city from surrounding black townships like   and many immigrants from economically beleaguered and war torn African nations flooded into South Africa. Many buildings were abandoned by  , especially in high-density areas, such as  . Many corporations and institutions, including the  , moved their headquarters away from the city centre, to suburbs like  . 
 Reviving the city centre is one of the main aims of the municipal government of Johannesburg. Drastic measures have been taken to reduce crime in the city. These measures include   on street corners. As of 11 December 2008, every street corner in Johannesburg central is under high-tech   surveillance.  The CCTV system, operated by the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD), is also able to detect stolen or hijacked vehicles by scanning the number plates of every vehicle travelling through the central business district (CBD), then comparing them to the eNaTIS database. The JMPD claims that the average response time by police for crimes committed in the CBD is 60 seconds. 
 Crime levels in Johannesburg have dropped as the economy has stabilised and begun to grow.  Between 2001 and 2006, R9-billion (US$1.2 billion) has been invested in the city centre. Further investment of around R10-billion (US$1.5 billion) is expected in the city centre alone by 2010. This excludes development directly associated with the 2010 FIFA World Cup.  In an effort to prepare Johannesburg for the  , local government enlisted the help of  , former  , to help bring down the crime rate, as the opening and closing matches of the tournament were played in the city. 
  in the Johannesburg municipality amounted to 1,697 in 2007 according to the South African Medical Research Council, a rate of 43 per 100,000 inhabitants.  In 2016 that number had sharply declined to 29.4 per 100,000 inhabitants, placing the murder rate at more than half of that of   and even below the national average. 
 Johannesburg is a cultural hub in South Africa  and has a wide variety of cultural venues, making it a prominent area for many creative and cultural industries. 
 Johannesburg is home to the National School of Arts, The University of Witwatersrand's School of the Arts and the South African Ballet Theatre,  as well as the   and other prominent cultural landmarks, such as the   and numerous other museums, theatres, galleries and libraries. 
 The   is located in the Central Business District of Johannesburg. 
 Specialist museums cover subjects such as Africana, costume, design,  , geology,  , medical,  , photography and transportation networks such as railways.  , a living museum, was originally part of the Crown Mines Complex, where gold was mined to a depth of 3,000 metres (9,800 ft). The   stages plays, comedy shows, and musical performances.
 The following is a list of some of the museums and galleries that can be found in Johannesburg. 
 Johannesburg hosts many of South Africa's premier music events, such as  's Johannesburg leg,    and many international tours from bands and artists around the world.  Several critically acclaimed musical acts come from Johannesburg, such as  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  .
 The   complex hosts drama, opera and ballet.

 Public art ranges from sculptures to murals to pieces by artists like   and  's  . Many pieces are developed through community workshops, such as the Vilakazi Street sculptures. Others are functional, such as street furniture found in   and the city centre. 
 As part of the Johannesburg Development Agency's (JDA) policy to make city areas desirable to potential investors, the organisation has identified public art as a way to improve the urban experience of the city.  The JDA spends 1 percent of all projects of over R10-million on public art. 
 Johannesburg is home to some of Africa's tallest structures, such as the  ,  , the   and  . The Johannesburg city skyline has most of the tallest buildings on the continent and contains most international organisations such as  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   and  . Many of the city's older buildings have been demolished and more modern ones built in their place. North of the CBD is  , the most densely populated residential area in southern Africa. Northwest of the CBD is  , a secondary CBD housing many offices and business premises. The CBD is predominated by four styles of architecture, being  ,  ,   and  .
 The city is often described as Africa's economic powerhouse, and contentiously as a modern and prosperous African city.  Johannesburg, like many metropolises, has more than one central business district (CBD), including, but not limited to, Sandton, Rosebank and Roodepoort in addition to the original CBD. Some tend to include Benoni and Germiston as well.
 Due to its many different central districts, Johannesburg would fall under the   in   terms. It is the hub of South Africa's commercial, financial, industrial, and mining undertakings. Johannesburg is part of a larger urban region. It is closely linked with several other satellite towns.   and   form part of the northern area. The east and west ridges spread out from central Johannesburg. The Central Business District covers an area of 6 square kilometres (2 sq mi). It consists of closely packed skyscrapers such as the  ,  ,  ,  ,   and  .
 Johannesburg's city centre retains its elements of a rectangular grid pattern that was first officially recorded in 1886.  Streets are narrow and filled with high rises built in the mid- to late 1900s. Old Victorian–era buildings first built in the late 1800s have been torn down long ago.  The 1900s brought along with it the introduction of many different architectural styles and structures. The Johannesburg Art Gallery and Supreme Court Building being two examples. These were important Beaux-Arts structures, with the style put in place by (at the time) colonial parent, the British Empire.  South Africa didn't borrow architectural techniques exclusively from Britain, however. They were also inspired by American models and styles, having built several structures like the ESKOM Building and the Corner House to emulate the prowess of New York City, located in the United States.

 Johannesburg is a young and sprawling city, with its public transportation built in its infancy, geared towards private motorists, and lacks a convenient public transportation system. The City though has invested a large percentage of its budget toward an effective integrated public transportation system. A significant number of the city's residents are dependent on the city's informal minibus taxis. 
 Johannesburg shares a network of   with   and  . The fact that Johannesburg is not near a large navigable body of water has meant that ground transportation has been the most important method of transporting people and goods in and out of the city. One of Africa's most famous "beltways" or ring roads/orbitals is the  . The road is composed of three freeways that converge on the city, forming an 80-kilometre (50 mi) loop around it: the  , which links Johannesburg with  ; the  , which links Johannesburg with   and  ; and the  , which links Johannesburg with   and  . The   was built exclusively with  , while the   and   sections were made with concrete, hence the nickname given to the N1 Western Bypass, "The Concrete Highway". In spite of being up to 12 lanes wide in some areas, the Johannesburg Ring Road is frequently clogged with traffic. The Gillooly's Interchange, built on an old farm and the point at which the N3 Eastern Bypass and the   intersect, is the busiest interchange in the Southern Hemisphere.  It is claimed  that the N1 is the busiest road in South Africa.
 Johannesburg has the most freeways connected to it.  It has the  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   and the  , all leading to Johannesburg. The   and   freeways were built to direct traffic towards the city centre. These two freeways are congested due to mass urbanisation.
 Johannesburg is served by a bus fleet operated by     11 February 2005 at the  , a corporate unit of the City of Johannesburg. It has a fleet consisting of approximately 550 single and double-decker buses, plying 84 different routes in the city. This total includes 200 modern buses (150 double-deckers and 50 single-deckers), made by  ,   and Marcopolo/Brasa in 2002. Metrobus' fleet carries approximately 20 million passengers per annum. In addition, there are a number of private bus operators, though most focus on the inter-city routes, or on bus charters for touring groups. The city's main bus terminus is situated in  , where passengers can also obtain information regarding the Metrobus service from the walk-in customer information desk.
 In 2010, in order to create an efficient public transport system the   bus rapid system was developed/built. The buses run on their own dedicated bus lanes on the main trunk and complementary routes. The buses also have large feeder routes that run on ordinary roads. The Rea Vaya works on a smartcard payment system, on entering the station or bus the passenger taps his/her smartcard onto the validator/scanner and taps out at the next station with the calculated amount. The routes cover both the southern and northern suburbs with the main trunk route running from Soweto to Sandton and Rosebank, and the feeder and complementary routes covering most of Johannesburg, with the notable exceptions of Midrand and Centurion. A subsequent expansion (phase 1-C;1-D) will cover these areas. In 2017, the   bus rapid transit was recorded to be making huge losses recovering only about 40 per cent of the operating costs and relying heavily on government subsidies. 
 Johannesburg has two kinds of taxis,   and  . Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city looking for passengers and instead must be called and ordered to a destination. The Gauteng Provincial Government has launched a new metered taxi programme in an attempt to increase the use of metered taxis in the city. 
 The minibus "taxis" are the   standard and essential form of transport for the majority of the population. Since the 1980s, the minibus taxi industry has been severely affected by  . 
 Johannesburg is served principally by   (formerly Johannesburg International Airport and before that Jan Smuts Airport) for both domestic and international flights.  , located to the north-west of the city and closer to the business hub of  , is used for commercial flights to  ,  ,  , Botswana, and  . Other airports include   and  . Rand Airport, located in  , is a small airfield used mostly for private aircraft and the home of  ' first Boeing 747–200 ZS-SAN and also 747SP ZS-SPC and now serves as an aviation museum. Grand Central is located in Midrand and also caters to small, private aircraft.
 The     system connects central Johannesburg to  ,  , and most of the satellite towns along the  . The railways transport huge numbers of commuters every day. However, the Metrorail infrastructure was built in Johannesburg's infancy and covers only the older areas in the city's south. The northern areas, including the business districts of  ,  ,  , and  , are served by the rapid   link  .
 A part of the Gauteng Provincial Government's Blue IQ Project,   has made provision for a rapid   link, running north to south, between Johannesburg and Pretoria, and west to east between Sandton and the  . Construction of the Gautrain Rapid Rail started in October 2006 and was completed in June 2012. It consists of a number of underground stations, as well as above-ground stations. Stations on the north–south line include Johannesburg's   (underground),   (underground),   (underground),   (above-ground and raised),  ,   Station and  . There is also a line from the O.R. Tambo International Airport (above-ground and raised) travelling to Sandton via   (raised) and Marlboro. A 200-kilometre expansion is underway and will consist of 3 new lines and 18 new stations, and is expected to cost R18 billion and one-lines (Soweto Mamalodi) could take 4 years to build, most of the new stations will be in Johannesburg.
 The east–west line from the airport to Sandton opened in June 2010 in time for the  , while the north–south line opened on 2 August 2011, except for Park Station, which opened in 2012.
 The rail system was designed to alleviate traffic on the   freeway between Johannesburg and Pretoria, which records vehicle loads of up to 300,000 per week day.  An extensive bus feeder system has also been implemented, which allows access to the main stations from the outer suburbs, but is limited to a five-kilometre radius, which neglects the rest of the suburbs. This is the first new major railway system that has been laid in South Africa since 1977. 
 In 2010, a   was proposed between Johannesburg and  .  In 2020 the government announced plans for high-speed rail from Johannesburg to  . 
 City Deep Terminal is the name of Africa's largest   and was officially opened by the South African Railways Services (SARS) in 1977. The container terminal is connected to the Port of Durban, Port of Ngqurha, Port of Cape Town, as well as Southern Africa by road and rail. At least forty percent of container export/imports run on the Natal Corridor (Natcor) which is directly linked by rail to City Deep.
